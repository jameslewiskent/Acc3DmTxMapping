This code is from the ESPIRiT toolbox v3. I have slightly edited the C file to alter 
the seed and remove MATLAB display output to speed up for generating lots of masks.

Note: If not running, go to this directory in MATLAB and
use the command 'mex vdPoisMex.c' in MATLAB's Command Window to build mex.
